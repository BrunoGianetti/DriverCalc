# Welcome to my first Python Project - DriverCalc.

Here you can see a simple (but efficient) code that I apply everyday in my job.

## How it work

I use a six variables and one math expression that give me a price. Then we would see a conditional chain to scale prices balanced with Uber prices.

## How I use it in my job

I receive calls in my whatsapp and ask my client about loading and unloading. Then I go to google maps and plot the rote and print it to my client. With gps data in hands, I put then on the DriverCalc, print it too as a receipt and send to client. When he/she agree, we ride.
